    "Here in this project I have audited, cleaned and analyzed OpenStreetMap data for Kolkata, West Bengal, India. What I have found during the process was many excess, deprecated tags without proper wiki. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1 Ideas for additional improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I got curious to know how actually places are created in OSM. I can easily create **any key** without those listed in the dropdown. The screenshot makes it clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](../Screenshots/1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can easily find my edit in OSM (if still available) in this [link](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/519564562). Here's a screenshot showing my update is live.\n",
    "![title](../Screenshots/2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what I think is, OSM should not allow creation of **any tag** and be reserved to some extent. Since this organization is community-driven, it is good to have a review policy (from high contributing users of that locality) to make things more accurate. Also various issues that I faced like variation in letter-cases, abbreviation of street names, states, brands can be nullified with some simple hints and validations before actual entry in the database. Anomaly in postcodes can be eliminated by hinting users of nearby postcodes (so that in cases of hit, it can be auto-filled) and before entry validating the digit-count defined in that country. Also there is no need to store redundant data like country, state, city for every node if it's latitude and longitude falls within the area defined by the respective country, state and city\n",
    ").\n",
    "\n",
    "Now a relative competitor to this **editable** feature of OSM is **Google Local Guides** program that is though not much flexible but attracts more users due to their **rewards** (level-based). This can be used as a motivating factor for more contributions to OSM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also I found [tagsinfo](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) really helpful. But if there are specific tags that a particular country is using, (like **IR:zone** means **Indian Railways - zone**) proper wiki should be provided before the usage. This makes OSM more documented and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.2 Anticipated problems in implementing the improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***The idea of getting an edit reviewed by some high-contributing user may not always work***\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: Some users who has a large number of edits does not necessarily means that he knows my neighborhood better than me. He might reject my edits to a road or cell number of a store. It is not quite feasible that each and every edit is being reviewed with justice. I badly want to give an example to demonstrate the negative effects of getting every edit reviewed in Google LG program. Although I know my locality best and have given the best possible suggestions, they are not approved. \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](../Screenshots/3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***There can be collisions of edits/creation of new places if they had to pass through a review queue***\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Suppose there's an opening of a new shop. The business owner might have created a node for his shop. Now, it is obvious I won't be knowing this and suppose I re-create the same place. Well the system won't reject it if there's some variation in name. The owner created with \"ABC & sons Pvt Ltd.\" while I did with \"ABC\". Now? Duplication of same place will happen and again another request for removal of duplicate entry needs to be addressed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* ***However be the proposals of new tags are administered, it still possess the risk of ether being absurd or rejected***\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Even I did not understand the meaning of IR:zone until I saw the combination of its values like ER (Eastern Railway), SER (South-Eastern Railway) and so on. Now this things if administered from outside India may be rejected due to lack of clarity and it's acceptable. However \"THANA_NAME\" is unique for Bangladesh and equivalent to our district. Now if they are forced to use district, then it destroys the whole idea of localization.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* ***To the best of my knowledge, redundancy and validation improvements can be carried out without any problems***\n",
    "\n",
    "    At least in Kolkata all postal-codes are solid polygonal areas and mutually exclusive. Now if they are not solid and have holes (of other postal-codes) in them then it may be hard to implement but if not mutually exclusive then, it's impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However if the data is collected from individual then it may be prone to errors. Best demarcations can be provided by the Municipality."
